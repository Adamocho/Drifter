# Drifter
Game prototype about Cars, Shooting and Drifting. Made in Unity

## About

### The story behind it

I was asked to make an application which could be a web app, mobile app, or just a game. That's why it's here.
It's not yet finished, but I'll keep working on it, if I'll have any free time. 

### What's the game about

> Cars, Shooting and Drifting.

What more an ordinary male would need to be happy? Nothing.

### Tools I used

- Blender
- Unity
- The internet *obviously*
